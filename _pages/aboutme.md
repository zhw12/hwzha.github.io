My Research
======
My research lies between natural language processing and data mining. Particularly, I focus on extracting and inferring knowledge from unstructed text and structured graph, where such knowledge can facilitate intelligent analysis and applications. I am interested in developing label efficient, easy-to-digest and user friendly models.
