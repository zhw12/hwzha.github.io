My Research
======
My research lies between data mining and natural language processing. Particularly, I focus on mining structured knowledge from unstructured text and constructing knowledge graph, where such knowledge can facilitate intelligent analysis and applications. I am interested in developing models that learn in weakly-supervised settings, where data are noisy and incompletely-labeled.
